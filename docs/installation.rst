Stable release
--------------

.. todo::

   This ``perfume`` is not on PyPI yet, there's another ``perfume``
   there.  Still working on deciding the right thing to do about that.

To install perfume, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install https://github.com/leifwalsh/perfume

This is the preferred method to install perfume, as it will always install the most recent stable release. 

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io

From sources
------------

The sources for perfume can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/leifwalsh/perfume

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/leifwalsh/perfume/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/leifwalsh/perfume
.. _tarball: https://github.com/leifwalsh/perfume/tarball/master
